Tiny simulator of [Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan).

I have implemented a simple vesrion of [Backprojection Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction) for reconstruction of the tomographic image.

TODO: implement a version of reconstruction algorithm, based on the Fourier Transformation.
